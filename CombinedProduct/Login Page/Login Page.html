  This is the login page of our Chalkboard. Here the user can enter their email and password, then click login to enter the homepage. If they forgot their username or password they click the forgot username/password option. This will bring them to a new page to reset their username or password. If the user is a first time user, they can have the option to make an account and they will be brought to a new page. If they click Chalkboard at the top of the page it will not do anything.
